# Data-Pipeline-Automation-BMW-Sales-
Built an automated ETL pipeline orchestrated with Apache Airflow (extract → transform → load) to process BMW sales data. Cleaned and standardized fields and created derived attributes (e.g., Sales_Classification) for downstream analytics. Loaded curated data into MongoDB and validated ingestion at scale (150K documents).
